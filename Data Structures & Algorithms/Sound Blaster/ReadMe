HW #1 Sound Blaster! Write-Up

1)I created my own .dat file to run against my code, and I also ran bot.dat and secret.dat
  against it.

2)The scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.

3)My array would have to double 17 times to handle 1 million lines. If there were 
  1 billion lines, the array would have to double 27 times. If there were
  1 trillion lines it would need to double be 37 times. Because my array starts with a size 
  of ten, the equation to solve for the number of times needed is 
  is 10*2^(x) = y, where y is1 million,1 billion,1 trillion. X is the number of 
  times the array would have to double. You would need to round up if you get a decimal
  because you must accommodate the extra lines.
  
4)push(double d){
      new Queue q1;  //make a new queue
      q1.enqueue(d); //add new items to back of queue
  }
  
  pop double (){
      if isEmpty throw exception
      else{
         for(i = 0; i < queue.size - 1 ; i++){ //add items from the front to the back 
            q1.dequeue(q1.enqueue())           //    until the front is the one that 
         }                                     //    was originally at the back of the queue
         return q1.dequeue;                    

  }
   
5)The implementation I used for the queue has an O(N) runtime, instead of an O(1) runtime for
  the array implementation. However, the benefits of using the queue implementation is that 
  there is no wasted space compared to the the array which might have empty cells. I would 
  choose an array implementation for larger inputs because it would be faster than a queue.
  
6)I implemented my array to halve in size when the array is 1/4 full.

7)I liked that it refreshed my memory in concepts that should have been review. 
  It was a good first homework assignment after being removed from programming for
  a while.
